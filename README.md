# Mini projects for Snap!

This package contains my scripts that you can load on [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/).
It is part of the [educational repository](http://www.coderdojofosso.it/download/) to learn how to write code by blocks.
Educational repository is an italian page because the material is used by an italian team of [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com/).

If you have any problem, create an issue.
